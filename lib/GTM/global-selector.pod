=head1 Global Selector

=head2 Patterns

=over 4

=item B<NAME> selects ^NAME

=item B<-NAME> unselects ^NAME

=item B<NAME-NAME> select all globals that match the range.

=item B<?> matches exact one character

=item B<*> matches zero or more characters

=item B</invert> inverts the selection.
This is helpful if you want to select many globals except a few.
Here an example:
normally you select all globals and deselect a few:

  *
  -notthis
  -except

This is confusing because there are so many globals selected.
With B</invert> this example looks like this:

  notthis
  except
  /invert
